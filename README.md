TriviaGame Homework by CaraFelise

This Trivia Game has a timer with multiple choices. The player has limited time to finish the quiz. The game ends when the time runs out or when the done button is clicked. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answered correctly, incorrectly and unanswered. It plays some sound clips when the game is over or while displaying the scores. It also has some animation added.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using jQuery, Javascript timers, Bootstrap, HTML and, CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
